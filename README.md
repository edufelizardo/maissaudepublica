# MorePublicHealth
## Description
 The Public Health Management Project is a system that aims to computerize and optimize the management of patients' health information, in order to facilitate the work of healthcare professionals. For this, the system allows the creation of electronic medical records, registration of appointments, exams, medical prescriptions, treatments, and other relevant information.

The application was developed using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Docker, and Jenkins technologies. It is a Restful API that allows for the registration and consultation of patients, doctors, appointment scheduling, registration of exams, treatments, and medical prescriptions, as well as other functionalities pertinent to a public health management system.

This READER was developed with the aim of providing an overview of the system and instructions for installation, configuration, and execution for developers, managers, and other interested parties in the project. With this, it is hoped that the Public Health Management Project can contribute significantly to improving the management of health information throughout the country.

#### Key Features:

* Registration and management of patients
* Creation and management of electronic medical records
* Registration of medical appointments
* Registration of exams performed
* Prescription of medicines and treatments
* Management of medical care coverage areas
* Integration with hospital information systems
 
### Motivation
 This project was initially conceived as a spreadsheet developed by nurses in a health unit, with the aim of optimizing and improving their processes. My wife asked for my help in making this spreadsheet more efficient, and so we decided to implement it using Visual Basic .NET and Windows Forms for the frontend, and it would become **+MaisSaúdePMA**. It was a fantastic experience, but due to some setbacks, I had to stop the project for a while. Now, I am resuming it with new implementations and using the most current technologies of the moment.
